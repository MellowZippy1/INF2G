A binary search is used to find the index of an item in a **sorted** list.

# How does it work?

A binary search is basically a higher-lower game for finding an element. You can remove 50% of a list if you know if the value is higher or lower than the middle element.

A binary search usually takes 7 or less tries to find an item in a sorted list.
