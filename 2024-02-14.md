More network exercises:

1)

a) A, B, C, D, F, G, E

b) B

c) B

d) F, E

e) G, F, E, C

2)

a) To have the maximum possible throughput you would have 1500 bytes of data and 0 bytes of pad. Checksum has a fixed size and so does the overhead.

b) I assume bandwidth is only the amount of payload you can send.

Each frame is 22 + 1500 + 4 = 1526 bytes. In 10Mbit/s you can send about 10.000.000 bits / 8 / 1526 frame size = 819 frames per second.

Each frame has 1500 bytes of payload so 1500 bytes * 819 frames = 1228500 bytes.

So you have 1228500 (bits) * 8  = 9.8Mb/s bandwidth (of payload).

Another way to check this:

You can send 819 frames per second.
Each frame has 26 bytes of non-payload data.

819 * 26 = 21294 bytes of information that is not payload. So 170.352 bits that aren't payload. 

(Checks out because 10 million - 170 thousand is roughly 9.8m).
