Transmission refers to the process of sending and receiving media between devices over a network using transmission media. 
# Transmission media

A transmission medium is anything that can carry information from a source to a destination. Usually transmission media is either free space, metallic cable or fibre-optic cable. These can be divided into two (broad) categories:

1. Guided
2. Unguided
## Guided

Guided media, are those that provide a conduit from one device to another. Such as twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable and fibre optic cable.
## Unguided

Unguided media (wireless communication) transport electromagnetic waves without a physical conductor. [Signals](Signal.md) are normally broadcast through free space and thus are available to anyone who has a device capable of receiving them.

# Transmission Impairments

A signal may face some problems during transmission. These are called transmission impairments. The most important ones are:

- Loss of energy - **attenuation**
	- Solution: Divide the communication line into short segments and use amplifiers between segments.
- Change of shape - **distortion**
	- Solution: Use a lower bit rate, this will lengthen the duration and therefore less susceptible to distortion.
- **Noise**
	- Solution: Use a stronger signal power compared to the estimated average noise power to reduce the impact of noise. ([SNR](SNR.md)).
