Signals are [waves](Waves) with added data. To transform information from a computer (digital format) into a signal you need an encoder. The [physical layer](Physical%20Layer.md) does this. Signals are also susceptible to [transmission impairments](Transmission.md#Transmission%20Impairments)

A signal can be either analog or digital. An analog signal can have an infinite number of values in a range where as a digital can only have a limited number of  values.

# Data Modulation

Adding data to a [carrier](Waves#Carrier%20Wave) is called modulation. Data can be added to a carrier by either its:
- Height - amplitude
- Rate of changes per second - Frequency
- Shift - phase

> Data can be either analog or digital. Analog data are continuous and take continuous values whereas digital data has discrete states and take discrete values.
