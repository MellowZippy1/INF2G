- What is the optimal path?

In a [point-to-point](Point-to-Point) network messages are transmitted from the source network to the destination network through the optimum path. Which is the path from one host to another with the least amount of latency.

To identify networks and hosts you need addresses. The network layer is responsible for defining addresses.
