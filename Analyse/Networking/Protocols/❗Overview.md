### What is a protocol?

A protocol is an agreement between the communicating parties on how communication is to proceed.
### What are protocols for?

Network protocols are designed in multiple layers to hide hardware details from the user. This way when a layer is replaced, other layers do not get affected. For example, Skype will continue to work even if we change a wired net connection to a wireless net connection.
### How to design a layered protocol?

There is a model by the International Organization for Standardization, referred to as the [OSI model](OSI%20Model.md), which has 7 layers.

1. [Physical](01%20Physical)
2. [Data link](02%20Data%20Link)
3. [Network](03%20Network)
4. [Transport](04%20Transport)
5. [Session](05%20Session)
6. [Presentation](06%20Presentation)
7. [Application](07%20Application)
