The interconnection between the computers in a computer network can be one of the two ways:
- A shared medium over which data is [broadcast](Broadcasting).
- A [Point-to-Point](Point-to-Point) data exchange.
### When to use each model?

Small networks have lighter traffic
- Meaning there is a lower probability of collision (smaller network dimension).
- The broadcast model better suits these networks.

Large networks have heavy traffic:
- Point-to-point model is more fitting because it avoids collisions that you would have with a broadcasting network.
