In broadcasts networks, a message is sent to everyone (hosts) in the network.
- Only the intended recipient(s) reads it.
- Every other host will ignore the message.

# Disadvantages
- You cannot send several messages at the same time (collision problem).
- All messages are sent to every member, so...
	- It suffers from heavy traffic load.
	- These networks cannot scale up, therefore better viable for small networks.
